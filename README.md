## 🧠 Development Approach

* Focused on **clean and user-friendly UI** with a fully responsive design.
* Used **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`) for state and performance optimization.
* **Material UI** was chosen for its modern components and built-in responsiveness.
* Implemented **pagination** for smoother browsing through large datasets.
* Added **error handling and retry** logic for better reliability.
* Mock data is loaded from `src/api/companies.json` to simulate an API call.
